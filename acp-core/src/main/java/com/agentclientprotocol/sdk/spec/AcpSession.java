/**
 * Represents an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) session that handles communication between
 * clients and agents. This interface provides methods for sending requests and
 * notifications, as well as managing the session lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>
 * The session operates asynchronously using Project Reactor's {@link Mono} type for
 * non-blocking operations. It supports both request-response patterns and one-way
 * notifications.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ACP is bidirectional - both clients and agents can send requests to each other:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Client → Agent: initialize, newSession, prompt, setSessionMode, etc.</li>
 * <li>Agent → Client: readTextFile, writeTextFile, requestPermission, sessionUpdate,
 * etc.</li>
 * </ul>
